# ForkGitResetCommit  
A little tool I made for resetting my last commit when encountering after pushing with Fork.  
Basically a batch file with git commands. Tested with Fork and Git-2.47.1.2 on Windows 10.  

I've also included some icons for the batch file shortcut. I think they encapsulate the mood when you need to do this.
